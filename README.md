## Before the workshop:
You will need the following programs: Google chrome. Python, MATLAB.\
To use python I recommend anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/download. You can use spyder or vscode IDEs within Anaconda Navigator to start coding in python. 

### Install the following python packages by typing the following commands in the console:

### Request access to dataset hosted by Zenodo.
Once approved to access the dataset, choose your favourite organism and download the appropriate .zip file.\
Open the folder. You should see a .hic file in the folder.\
If your folder doesn't have a .hic file don't worry, download another organism from zenodo.

## Open https://aidenlab.org/juicebox/ in chrome.
Open your .hic file using juicebox. You should see a plot of your HiC matrix. You can use the dropdown menus to navigate to different chromosomes/HiC_SCAFFOLDS.\
